def knapsack(tasks, max_effort):
    """
    Implements a 0/1 Knapsack algorithm to select the optimal set of tasks within the given effort limit.

    Each task's `effort` is treated as both its weight and its value â€” we want to maximize the total effort
    used without exceeding the `max_effort` (weekly capacity).

    Tasks are then sorted by priority and timestamp to reflect business rules.

    Args:
        tasks (List[Task]): List of task objects to choose from.
        max_effort (int): The maximum effort capacity available.

    Returns:
        List[Task]: Optimally selected and sorted list of tasks that fit within the effort constraint.
